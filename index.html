    <h2>Why is AI such an issue for artists?</h2>
    <p>GenAI programs use artists artwork, without their consent, to generate their images. Many artists find it difficult to avoid this happening or find it hard to add protections against AI to their art. This issue is unavoidable, as many artists rely on social media to get their art noticed, which leaves them vulnerable to their art being stolen by AI.</p>
